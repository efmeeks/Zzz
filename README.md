# zzz

`zzz` is a command line tool to blank your Mac display without putting the machine to sleep.

It is the cli equivalent of [Control–Shift–Eject](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236).

*macOS only*

> **Why not just press ⌃⇧⏏ ?**
> If you can physically press the keys, then by all means do that. However, Zzz is intended for applications where the user is not within reach of the physical machine e.g. remote ssh.

## Try
```bash
curl -sL file.efmeeks.net/zzz/zzz.sh | bash
```

## Get

```bash
bash <(curl -sL file.efmeeks.net/zzz/zzz.sh) install
```
