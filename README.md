# Zzz

A command line tool that blanks your Mac display without putting the machine to sleep.

It is the command line equivalent of [Control–Shift–Eject](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236).

*Note: This only works on OS X*

## Why not just press ⌃⇧⏏ ?
If you can physically press the keys, then by all means do that. However, Zzz is intended for applications where the user is not within reach of the physical machine e.g. remote ssh.

## Usage
### Download Zzz.zip
[Zzz.zip](../files/Zzz.zip)
### Unzip the archive
`unzip Zzz.zip`
### Open the folder
`cd Zzz`
### Ensure `zzz.sh` is executable
`chmod +x zzz.sh`
### Run `zzz.sh`
`./zzz.sh`
